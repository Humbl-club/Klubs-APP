# ðŸš€ MULTI-TENANT MIGRATION GUIDE

## Current Status
The database migrations have been prepared and are ready to apply. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating your database to multi-tenant architecture.

## Migration Files Created

### Day 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation
**File**: `supabase/migrations/100_day1_complete_multitenant.sql`

This migration:
- âœ… Creates `organizations` and `organization_members` tables
- âœ… Creates a default organization "Humbl Girls Club"
- âœ… Migrates all existing users to the default organization
- âœ… Adds `organization_id` to all 43 existing tables
- âœ… Updates all existing data with the default organization_id
- âœ… Creates helper functions for organization context

### Day 2: Security & Performance
**File**: `supabase/migrations/101_day2_security_indexes.sql`

This migration:
- âœ… Updates all RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation
- âœ… Creates 35+ composite indexes for performance
- âœ… Adds performance monitoring functions
- âœ… Creates materialized views for dashboard optimization
- âœ… Sets up audit logging

## How to Apply Migrations

### Option 1: Using Supabase Studio (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase Studio**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase start
   # Studio will be available at http://localhost:54323
   ```

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**:
   - Open http://localhost:54323
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. **Apply Day 1 Migration**:
   - Click "New Query"
   - Copy the entire content of `supabase/migrations/100_day1_complete_multitenant.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
   - Wait for completion (should show success messages)

4. **Verify Day 1**:
   - Run the verification script:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as org_count FROM organizations;
   SELECT COUNT(*) as member_count FROM organization_members;
   ```
   - You should see at least 1 organization and user counts

5. **Apply Day 2 Migration**:
   - Create a new query
   - Copy the entire content of `supabase/migrations/101_day2_security_indexes.sql`
   - Paste and run
   - This creates indexes and policies (may take a few minutes)

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

1. **Reset and apply all migrations**:
   ```bash
   # Reset database to clean state
   npx supabase db reset
   
   # Push all migrations
   npx supabase db push --local
   ```

2. **If you get errors about missing tables**, it means some migrations are out of order. Apply them manually:
   ```bash
   # Connect to local database
   npx supabase db remote set postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
   
   # Apply migrations in order
   npx supabase db push --local --include-all
   ```

### Option 3: Using the Migration Script

1. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x apply_migrations.sh
   ```

2. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   ./apply_migrations.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to apply migrations

## Verification Steps

### 1. Run Verification Query
Use `verify_database.sql` to check the migration status:

```bash
# In Supabase Studio SQL Editor, run:
# Copy content from verify_database.sql and execute
```

### 2. Expected Results
After successful migration, you should see:

```
âœ… Organizations table exists (1 organization)
âœ… Organization_members table exists (X members)
âœ… All main tables have organization_id column
âœ… 35+ performance indexes created
âœ… 15+ RLS policies active
```

### 3. Test Organization Context

```sql
-- Test: Get current user's organizations
SELECT * FROM organization_members 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test: Get organization data
SELECT * FROM organizations 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM organization_members 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Test: Check events with organization filter
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM organization_members 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Table does not exist" errors
**Cause**: Some tables haven't been created yet
**Solution**: The migrations are designed to be idempotent. Re-run them, and they'll skip existing objects.

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" errors
**Cause**: Using wrong credentials
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the service_role key for migrations

### Issue 3: "Duplicate key" errors
**Cause**: Migration already partially applied
**Solution**: The migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, safe to re-run

### Issue 4: Frontend still showing all data
**Cause**: Frontend hooks not updated yet
**Solution**: This is expected. Frontend updates come in Day 3-4.

## Migration Rollback

If you need to rollback:

```sql
-- Remove organization columns (CAUTION: This removes data!)
ALTER TABLE events DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
ALTER TABLE challenges DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
-- ... repeat for other tables

-- Drop organization tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organization_members;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations;

-- Remove new policies and indexes
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users view org events" ON events;
-- ... repeat for other policies
```

## Next Steps After Migration

### Day 3-4: Frontend Updates
1. Update all 54 hooks to use organization context
2. Add organization switcher component
3. Update dashboard queries

### Day 5: Testing
1. Test organization isolation
2. Load test with multiple organizations
3. Security audit

### Day 6-7: Production Deployment
1. Upgrade to Supabase Team plan
2. Configure CDN
3. Deploy to production

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Check Migration Logs
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_actions 
WHERE action = 'system_migration'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Monitor Performance
```sql
SELECT * FROM query_performance_logs
WHERE execution_time_ms > 1000
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Success Metrics

After successful migration, you should have:
- âœ… 1 default organization created
- âœ… All users migrated to default organization  
- âœ… 43 tables with organization_id column
- âœ… 35+ composite indexes for performance
- âœ… 15+ RLS policies for security
- âœ… Helper functions for organization management
- âœ… Materialized views for dashboard performance

## Important Notes

1. **Data Safety**: All migrations preserve existing data
2. **Idempotent**: Migrations can be run multiple times safely
3. **Performance**: Initial migration may take 5-10 minutes for large datasets
4. **Testing**: Always test in local/staging before production
5. **Backup**: Create a backup before production migration
